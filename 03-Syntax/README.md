# Javascript- Syntax

  JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

  You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within you web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.

  The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.

  |<script ...>                                                                                |
  |JavaScript code                                                                             |
  | </script>                                                                                  |
